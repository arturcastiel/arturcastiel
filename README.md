Hello, I am Dr. Artur Castiel Reis de Souza, a mechanical engineer passionate about computational fluid dynamics and the development of petroleum reservoir simulators. I am currently a reseacher at Federal University of Pernambuco in Brazil working with conservative formulations to simulate multi-phase flow in porous media. In specific, I am interested on linear and non-linear non-orthodox flux approximations and techniques to generalize the Multiscale Finite Volume family of methods to work with unstructured grids.
